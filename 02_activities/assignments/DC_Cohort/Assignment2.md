## Section 1:
You can start this section following *session 1*, but you may want to wait until you feel comfortable wtih basic SQL query writing. 

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Design a logical data model
- Duplicate the logical data model and add another table to it following the instructions
- Write, within this markdown file, an answer to Prompt 3


###  Design a Logical Model

#### Prompt 1
Design a logical model for a small bookstore. 📚

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. 

Additionally, include a date table. 
A date table (also called a calendar table) is a permanent table containing a list of dates and various components of those dates. Some theory, tips, and commentary can be found [here](https://www.sqlshack.com/designing-a-calendar-table/), [here](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/4054/creating-a-date-dimension-or-calendar-table-in-sql-server/) and [here](https://sqlgeekspro.com/creating-calendar-table-sql-server/). 
Remember, you don't actually need to run any of the queries in these articles, but instead understand *why* date tables in SQL make sense, and how to situate them within your logical models.

There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

**HINT:** You do not need to create any data for this prompt. This is a conceptual model only. 

#### Prompt 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

#### Prompt 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2? 

**HINT:** search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions. 

```
Type 1 architecture example [overwriting the previous address]
CUSTOMER_ADDRESS
------------------------
address_id (PK)
customer_id (FK)
street_address
city
province
postal_code
country

Type 2 architecture example [preserving the previous address]
CUSTOMER_ADDRESS
------------------------
address_history_id (PK)
customer_id (FK)
street_address
city
province
postal_code
country
effective_start_date
effective_end_date
is_current

## Section 2:
You can start this section following *session 4*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question, by writing responses between the QUERY # and END QUERY blocks
- Some questions build on your earlier queries or tables. Keep track of the column names you use so you can reference them correctly in later questions.


### Write SQL

#### COALESCE
1. Our favourite manager wants a detailed long list of products, but is afraid of tables! We tell them, no problem! We can produce a list with all of the appropriate details. 

Using the following syntax you create our super cool and not at all needy manager a list:
```
SELECT 
product_name || ', ' || product_size|| ' (' || product_qty_type || ')'
FROM product
```

But wait! The product table has some bad data (a few NULL values). 
Find the NULLs and then using COALESCE, replace the NULL with a blank for the first column with nulls, and 'unit' for the second column with nulls. 

**HINT**: keep the syntax the same, but edited the correct components with the string. The `||` values concatenate the columns into strings. Edit the appropriate columns -- you're making two edits -- and the NULL rows will be fixed. All the other rows will remain the same.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### Windowed Functions
1. Write a query that selects from the customer_purchases table and numbers each customer’s visits to the farmer’s market (labeling each market date with a different number). Each customer’s first visit is labeled 1, second visit is labeled 2, etc. 

You can either display all rows in the customer_purchases table, with the counter changing on each new market date for each customer, or select only the unique market dates per customer (without purchase details) and number those visits. 

**HINT**: One of these approaches uses ROW_NUMBER() and one uses DENSE_RANK().

Filter the visits to dates before April 29, 2022.

2. Reverse the numbering of the query so each customer’s most recent visit is labeled 1, then write another query that uses this one as a subquery (or temp table) and filters the results to only the customer’s most recent visit. 
**HINT**: Do not use the previous visit dates filter.

3. Using a COUNT() window function, include a value along with each row of the customer_purchases table that indicates how many different times that customer has purchased that product_id.

You can make this a running count by including an ORDER BY within the PARTITION BY if desired.
Filter the visits to dates before April 29, 2022.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### String manipulations
1. Some product names in the product table have descriptions like "Jar" or "Organic". These are separated from the product name with a hyphen. Create a column using SUBSTR (and a couple of other commands) that captures these, but is otherwise NULL. Remove any trailing or leading whitespaces. Don't just use a case statement for each product! 

| product_name               | description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Habanero Peppers - Organic | Organic     |

**HINT**: you might need to use INSTR(product_name,'-') to find the hyphens. INSTR will help split the column. 

2. Filter the query to show any product_size value that contain a number with REGEXP. 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### UNION
1. Using a UNION, write a query that displays the market dates with the highest and lowest total sales.

**HINT**: There are a possibly a few ways to do this query, but if you're struggling, try the following: 1) Create a CTE/Temp Table to find sales values grouped dates; 2) Create another CTE/Temp table with a rank windowed function on the previous query to create "best day" and "worst day"; 3) Query the second temp table twice, once for the best day, once for the worst day, with a UNION binding them.

## Section 3:
You can start this section following *session 5*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question, by writing responses between the QUERY # and END QUERY blocks

### Write SQL

#### Cross Join
1. Suppose every vendor in the `vendor_inventory` table had 5 of each of their products to sell to **every** customer on record. How much money would each vendor make per product? Show this by vendor_name and product name, rather than using the IDs.

**HINT**: Be sure you select only relevant columns and rows. Remember, CROSS JOIN will explode your table rows, so CROSS JOIN should likely be a subquery. Think a bit about the row counts: how many distinct vendors, product names are there (x)? How many customers are there (y). Before your final group by you should have the product of those two queries (x\*y). 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### INSERT
1. Create a new table "product_units". This table will contain only products where the `product_qty_type = 'unit'`. It should use all of the columns from the product table, as well as a new column for the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.  Name the timestamp column `snapshot_timestamp`.

2. Using `INSERT`, add a new row to the product_unit table (with an updated timestamp). This can be any product you desire (e.g. add another record for Apple Pie). 

<div align="center">-</div>

#### DELETE 
1. Delete the older record for whatever product you added.

**HINT**: If you don't specify a WHERE clause, [you are going to have a bad time](https://imgflip.com/i/8iq872).

<div align="center">-</div>

#### UPDATE
1. We want to add the current_quantity to the product_units table. First, add a new column, `current_quantity` to the table using the following syntax.
```
ALTER TABLE product_units
ADD current_quantity INT;
```

Then, using `UPDATE`, change the current_quantity equal to the **last** `quantity` value from the vendor_inventory details. 

**HINT**: This one is pretty hard. First, determine how to get the "last" quantity per product. Second, coalesce null values to 0 (if you don't have null values, figure out how to rearrange your query so you do.) Third, `SET current_quantity = (...your select statement...)`, remembering that WHERE can only accommodate one column. Finally, make sure you have a WHERE statement to update the right row, you'll need to use `product_units.product_id` to refer to the correct row within the product_units table. When you have all of these components, you can run the update statement.

### Ethics

Read: Boykis, V. (2019, October 16). _Neural nets are just people all the way down._ Normcore Tech. <br>
    https://vicki.substack.com/p/neural-nets-are-just-people-all-the

**What are some of the ethical issues important to this story?**

Consider, for example, concepts of labour, bias, LLM proliferation, moderating content, intersection of technology and society, ect. 

```
I found this article extremely interesting and eye-opening, particularly because I had never really considered the human labour underlying the development of artificial intelligence (AI). There is tremendous potential for AI and large language models (LLMs) to automate tasks, leverage large datasets, accelerate scientific discovery, and advance society. However, the article made me reflect on the ethical costs of these technological advancements and the extent to which they have relied on human exploitation.

One example that immediately came to mind was the CAPTCHA tests I remember completing when accessing websites, where I would have to identify traffic lights, bicycles, or cars in a grid of images. I had always assumed these were simply intended to verify that I was not a robot. I had never considered that similar image-classification activities could also contribute to machine-learning development, potentially without users fully appreciating how their input might be used. This made the discussion of Amazon Mechanical Turk particularly striking. While researchers were making incredible scientific advances that helped lay the foundation for technologies we use today, much of this work depended on individuals performing repetitive, poorly compensated, and largely unrecognized labour. To me, this reflects a broader problem with capitalism, where technological and economic progress can come at the expense of workers. The author's analogy to clothing manufacturing was particularly effective in illustrating that, despite our perception of automation, human labour remains fundamental to many technological processes. I believe we can advance society through innovation without sacrificing fairness, compensation, and recognition for the individuals making these advances possible.

The article also made me reflect on the growing adoption of AI across industries and the potential displacement of workers. Although AI promises greater efficiency and productivity, we should consider at what cost these efficiencies are achieved. Companies are increasingly exploring replacing human roles with AI, but whether this ultimately delivers meaningful improvements in productivity, profitability, or quality remains uncertain. More importantly, we need to consider the broader societal consequences of reducing human involvement in activities that require expertise, critical thinking, and judgment.

Another important concern is the introduction and perpetuation of bias through AI systems. As we discussed in the previous article, datasets are not inherently objective; they reflect the decisions, assumptions, and limitations of the individuals who collect and classify information. These biases can subsequently become embedded in the algorithms trained on these datasets. This is particularly concerning when AI is applied to high-stakes decisions, including military applications such as drone warfare and targeting, where errors or biased classifications can have devastating consequences. In my opinion, decisions involving human lives should never be fully delegated to automated systems without meaningful human accountability and oversight.

As a surgical resident, I am particularly interested in how AI will transform healthcare and medical education. Although I recognize its tremendous potential to improve clinical care, I also wonder how increasing automation will affect the training of future physicians. There is already growing interest in AI-assisted surgery and potentially more autonomous robotic procedures. While these technologies may eventually improve surgical precision and outcomes, what happens to surgical trainees if they are no longer performing the procedures themselves? Will future surgeons develop the necessary technical expertise and clinical judgment to intervene when an automated system fails? Who would ultimately be responsible for complications? I think this parallels concerns surrounding the use of LLMs in education. Although these tools can enhance learning, excessive reliance on them may undermine the process of struggling with difficult problems, developing independent reasoning, and acquiring foundational skills.

Finally, these concerns are particularly relevant to my own research using large administrative health databases. Much of the information in these databases is derived from physician documentation, diagnostic codes, billing records, and data abstractors. However, these records are not always accurate and may fail to capture important clinical context. As AI increasingly becomes involved in automating data abstraction and classification, I worry that models trained on imperfect information may simply reproduce or amplify existing errors and biases. Unlike a human abstractor who can seek clarification or consider additional clinical context, an LLM may generate plausible but inaccurate interpretations. This has important implications for the validity of research findings and, ultimately, clinical decision-making.

Overall, this article challenged me to think more critically about the human contributions underlying technologies that we increasingly take for granted. While I am enthusiastic about the potential of AI to advance science, medicine, and society, I believe these advances must be accompanied by greater transparency, accountability, and consideration of their consequences. Technological progress should not come at the cost of human dignity, equity, or self-developed expertise.
